 - Many thanks to Rob@USEast for his help on many features currently implemented into the bot. Also, his libbnet.dll which serves as the primary connection tool for Spiritual.
 - Also, many thanks to niNe@USEast for his help on many functions incorporated into the database system, and for his ideas and innovations with the GUI.
  	I recommend you also try out their bots as well: Emerge Bot (Rob's), and Slacker (niNe's)
 - And, thank you to the beta testers as well for using my bot and reporting bugs that may not have otherwise been found.

Build 139 - BETA

 - CHANGES
   - Re-wrote the local queue to fix a long standing drop issue after ~150 continuous bans. (Testing yielded over 1500 without dropping - I stopped it manually)
   - Modified Smartqueue to remove *all* queued ban users if they leave the channel, regardless of the ban type (i.e. Loadban)
   - Fixed squelching to detect and remove queued usernames who are set to be squelched but who gain flags 0x20 at the same time, and ditto for unsquelch as well
   - Improved automatic filtering when a load is detected, filtered usernames will now appear in red
   - Replaced the old filtermode system with the blacklist which is an automatic filtering mechanism
        - While a load is detected and a user who isn't supposed to be blacklisted gets flagged (their name is in red), simply safeadd them to avoid the ban and to remove their blacklist status
   - Created more strict rules for the automatic disabling of load detection to keep filtering on in the event no operator is banning a massload or flood
   - Fixed a bug which didn't display join messages when Join/Leaves are manually enabled during load detection
   - Modified the join/leaves disable toggle to ask the user whether or not to temporarily disable join/leaves during load detection
   - Changed ban messages: "Ignore" is now "Ipban" and "Lockout" is now "Evasion"
   - Added in automatic queue for chat messages (typed or copy pasta'd on the UI) longer than 255 characters (Thanks cHip)
   - Modified whisper commands - Spiritual will now always respond back in a whisper when whispered a command (The whisper commands setting will always whisper a command back if said aloud) (Thanks cHip)
   - Optimized a bunch of old code - Way too much to list...
   - Renamed plugin function "pCallCommand" to "pDispatchCommand" and renamed "pCallMessage" to "pDispatchMessage"
   - Added code to set focus back to textbox when double clicking a username in the listview
   - An error message is now displayed for users with flag I who try to execute a command without sufficient access (Thanks cHip)

   - When a user is safelisted, the queue is now checked and pending kick/bans and blacklist are removed
   - Fixed a duplicate collection element bug in the shared queue server
   - Added an "IP" button in the config under the queue server options to obtain your external ip address (This info is pulled directly from http://www.devacy.com/ip.php)
        - Note: I do not store or transmit your ip address. This feature is completely optional and you may choose to manually obtain your external IP by visiting various services on the web.
   - Handled socket 10048 issue with the queue server
   - Handled socket 10049 issue with the queue server

   - Added plugin function pEnqueueBan to allow plugins to take advantage of shared queue
   - Fixed a realm compatibility issue with chat encryption, so it is now re-enabled (Thanks divine)
   - Added a case sensitive password to the queue server for added security.  In addition, in order to auto-discover the queue server IP, you MUST be a channel operator.
   - Added a right-click option to the channel list to connect to that user's Spiritual Queue Service (SQS)
   - Added command connect to connect to a username's SQS
   - Added command sharequeue to turn queue sharing on/off
   - Fixed object variable error in 0x77 cookie lookup (Thanks Enkious)
   - Fixed a channel count error which occurs during the rapid joining and leaving of several usernames at once
   - Modified message splitting to a lower threshold due to bnet changing their maximum character limit for chat messages

Version 1.1 (Build: 36) - First pre-beta release

 -FEATURES
   - Plugins (plugins can override the entire connection system, and the entire command system).
        E.g. a single packet (or connection sequence) can be modified if Battle.net updates login methods
	Also, completely new commands can be added via plugins.
   - Aliases (aliasing allows you to create a 'shortcut' (or 'longcut') for commands
   - Auto-download hashes - Unfortunately, only available in the private release
   - Warden support [Private version will update if Warden changes]
   - Auto-download lockdown mpq files and extraction with storm.dll
   - Video buffer files are now handled internally
   - Support for all Battle.net products currently available
   - Automatic filtering for floodbots
   - Custom Icons (some are modifications of WAR3's but some I created myself, MSPaint ftw)
   - Multi-line tooltips (I think it deserves recognition here don't you?)
   - Listview auto-resize (Thanks to niNe@USEast) - The main listview resizes the 'username' column depending on whether a scrollbar is present or not.
   - Right-click channel/friends list options (clan right-click options coming soon)
   - Full D2 realm support
   - Account registration options (Change email/change pass/password recovery)
   - Initial account registering
   - Warcraft III clan support (invitations/clan creation)
   - RichTextBox no-scroll feature (allows you to scroll in the channel text without the scroll bar resetting to the bottom)
   - Bot mail
   - iTunes support (Will consider adding other various players)
   - Ping spoofing
   - Botlocking on admin siting (disables all commands -unless you have flag M- when a bnet administrator is in the channel)
   - Supports multi-exe loading
   - Emulate W2BN client support (Uses old login for W2BN instead of 0x50/0x51)

   - I'm sure there's more, I'm just forgetting to name them
